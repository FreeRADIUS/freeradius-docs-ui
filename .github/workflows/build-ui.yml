#  We can't create a release and keep updating it on every commit,
#  as we need a new tag for every release, and therefore every
#  commit. If we needed release versions then we could do this
#  based on tags, but it's not really worth it at the moment (code
#  below, however).
#
#  A stable URL is required, however. Currently there is no
#  support in Artifacts to get a fixed URL, so that isn't an
#  option either.
#
#  Instead we can just push the (small) zip file into another
#  orphan branch, and keep amending the commit. The URL will be
#  stable on github and we can easily update it here.
